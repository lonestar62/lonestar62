# Howdy, I'm Rodney Whiddon – Architecting the Future of AI-Driven Infrastructure

Hi, I’m **Rodney Whiddon**, Texas Aggie **Class of ’86**.  
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate technologist with over **29 years** of experience across DevOps, software engineering, and large-scale digital transformation. I specialize in **AI automation tooling**, **workflow orchestration**, and **cloud-native architecture** — where business, medicine, and communications meet bleeding-edge technology.

## 🚀 Current Missions

### 1️⃣ Modernizing AT&T's Voicemail Infrastructure  
Leading the migration and automation of a **90M-subscriber**, **6-region** Azure/Metaswitch voicemail system — transitioning from legacy Nokia hardware to a scalable, cloud-native platform.

### 2️⃣ Next-Gen E911 Emergency Platforms  
Designing and deploying **NENA-compliant**, AWS/Azure-based call-routing systems for **Intrado**, **Carbyne**, and **Motorola** to support AT&T's national ESINET PSAP transformation.

### 3️⃣ Business Development System  
Building a **cloud-native business development and lead intelligence platform** in Replit that integrates **NeonDB**, **Flask APIs**, and **Next.js dashboards** for real-time analytics.  
The system automates **CRM workflows, callbacks, IVR routing (Telnyx integration), customer engagement, and notifications**, enabling small businesses to scale with enterprise-grade tools.  
It also leverages **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for secure file handling and archival.

### 4️⃣ Document Management System  
Developing a **next-generation document management platform** in Replit using **NeonDB**, **Flask**, and **Next.js**.  
The system supports **intelligent search, workflow orchestration, automated tagging, and scalable storage** with **Google Cloud Storage integration**, designed to handle technical, business, and legal documentation.

### 5️⃣ Neurological Patent & Development Platform  
Creating a **multimodal AI system** for neurological diagnostics that fuses imaging, electrophysiology, lab data, and clinical notes into evolving patient profiles.  
The goal: a **cloud-based, doctor/patient-accessible platform** that tracks disease progression, supports longitudinal analysis, and powers the next generation of **AI-driven neurodiagnostics**.
