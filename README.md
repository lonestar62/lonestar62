## üöÄ Current Missions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Modernizing AT&T's Voicemail Infrastructure  
Leading the migration and automation of a **90M-subscriber**, **6-region** Azure/Metaswitch voicemail system ‚Äî transitioning from legacy Nokia hardware to a scalable, cloud-native platform.  

This initiative goes far beyond infrastructure migration ‚Äî it represents a **complete reinvention of operational support** through automation:  
- **Manpower Reduction via Automation**: Streamlining day-to-day support tasks with automated health checks, remediation workflows, and self-healing pipelines ‚Äî reducing operational overhead and freeing engineers from repetitive tasks.  
- **Markdown Documentation Automation**: Introducing a structured **Markdown + Jinja2 + frontmatter** documentation pipeline that dynamically generates runbooks, reference docs, and operational guides directly from the automation layer.  
- **AI-Driven Support Layer**: Integrating GPT-based assistants to parse logs, recommend fixes, generate summaries, and accelerate incident resolution ‚Äî transforming human-in-the-loop troubleshooting into **AI-augmented operations**.  
- **Ansible Server Automation**: Deploying **Ansible-based automation servers** to orchestrate thousands of configuration changes across regions, ensuring compliance, consistency, and auditability.  
- **MOP (Method of Procedure) Delivery Automation**: Automating the creation, sequencing, and delivery of **region-specific MOPs**, ensuring that deployments are reproducible, error-resistant, and version-controlled.  
- **Operational Transformation**: By combining **IaC (Terraform/Helm)** with **MOP automation, Ansible workflows, and AI insights**, the voicemail platform is evolving into a **self-documenting, self-healing, cloud-native system** with drastically lower OPEX.  

This project serves as a **blueprint for telco-scale operational automation**, proving how legacy infrastructure can be modernized into an **AI-powered, automation-first environment** at national scale.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Development System  
Building a **cloud-native business development and lead intelligence platform** that empowers small businesses with enterprise-grade tools. Core components:  
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Built in **Replit** with **NeonDB** for lead storage, structured customer records, and event tracking.  
- **APIs & Automation**: Flask-based APIs handle **callbacks, lead routing, appointment scheduling, and follow-ups**.  
- **Telnyx IVR Integration**: AI-powered phone tree and call routing system that makes a small business ‚Äúsound big.‚Äù  
- **Notification Layer**: Integrated **SMS/email messaging** for customer engagement and reminders.  
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Developed in **Next.js + Tailwind**, delivering real-time analytics, pipeline visibility, and team collaboration features.  
- **File & Asset Storage**: **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** integration for documents, recordings, and attachments linked to leads.  
- **AI Integration**: GPT-powered agents for lead qualification, dynamic call scripting, and intelligent response recommendations.  

The system‚Äôs goal is to provide a **turnkey CRM + communications hub** for small-town businesses, replacing outdated answering systems with an **AI-first, cloud-native platform**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Document Management System  
Developing a **next-generation intelligent document orchestration platform** designed for scalability, compliance, and automation. Key features:  
- **Data Layer**: **NeonDB** stores metadata, versioning, and access logs for every file.  
- **GCP Integration**: **Google Cloud Storage** handles file content, enabling high-volume, secure storage with redundancy.  
- **APIs & Backend**: Flask-powered APIs provide **upload, retrieval, permissions, and audit trails**.  
- **Frontend UI**: **Next.js + Tailwind** interface with **intelligent search, tagging, filtering, and document linking**.  
- **Automation Engine**: Automated **document classification, metadata extraction, and workflow triggers** (approvals, routing, archiving).  
- **Security & Compliance**: Role-based access, audit logs, and optional encryption-at-rest for regulated industries.  
- **AI Layer**: LLM-powered indexing and summarization allow users to query documents in natural language and generate auto-summaries.  

This project is designed as the backbone of an **enterprise-grade document ecosystem**, equally suited for **businesses, medical systems, and legal workflows**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Neurological Patent & Development Platform  
Building a **multimodal AI system** for neurological diagnostics and research that integrates:  
- **Medical Imaging Integration**: MRI, CT, PET, and EEG/MEG scans ingested into AI pipelines for multimodal fusion.  
- **Neurological Database Connectors**: Integration with existing **neurology research databases** and patient EMR data.  
- **NeonDB + GCP Data Lake**: Structured storage of longitudinal patient records, genetic/lab data, and annotated imaging for AI training and inference.  
- **Flask/Next.js UI**: Secure dashboards for doctors, researchers, and patients to view progression, compare timelines, and export structured reports.  
- **Longitudinal Profile Builder**: Tracks disease progression (e.g., MS, Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs) by fusing multimodal data into evolving **AI-generated patient profiles**.  
- **AI Orchestration Layer**: Uses GPT-based agents for **clinical note parsing, automated reporting, and treatment-plan suggestions**.  

The platform‚Äôs ultimate goal is to provide a **cloud-based neurodiagnostic ecosystem** ‚Äî accessible to hospitals, physicians, and patients ‚Äî that brings together **real-time medical scans, lab results, and clinical notes** into a single, intelligent interface to **improve accuracy, accelerate research, and support early detection**.
