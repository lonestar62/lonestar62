## 🚀 Current Missions

### 1️⃣ Modernizing AT&T's Voicemail Infrastructure  
Leading the migration and automation of a **90M-subscriber**, **6-region** Azure/Metaswitch voicemail system — transitioning from legacy Nokia hardware to a scalable, cloud-native platform.

### 2️⃣ Next-Gen E911 Emergency Platforms  
Designing and deploying **NENA-compliant**, AWS/Azure-based call-routing systems for **Intrado**, **Carbyne**, and **Motorola** to support AT&T's national ESINET PSAP transformation.

### 3️⃣ Business Development System  
Building a **cloud-native business development and lead intelligence platform** that empowers small businesses with enterprise-grade tools. Core components:  
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Built in **Replit** with **NeonDB** for lead storage, structured customer records, and event tracking.  
- **APIs & Automation**: Flask-based APIs handle **callbacks, lead routing, appointment scheduling, and follow-ups**.  
- **Telnyx IVR Integration**: AI-powered phone tree and call routing system that makes a small business “sound big.”  
- **Notification Layer**: Integrated **Twilio/SendGrid alternatives** for SMS/email engagement.  
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Developed in **Next.js + Tailwind**, delivering real-time analytics, pipeline visibility, and team collaboration features.  
- **File & Asset Storage**: **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** integration for documents, recordings, and attachments linked to leads.  
- **AI Integration**: GPT-powered agents for lead qualification, dynamic call scripting, and intelligent response recommendations.  

The system’s goal is to provide a **turnkey CRM + communications hub** for small-town businesses, replacing outdated answering systems with an **AI-first, cloud-native platform**.

### 4️⃣ Document Management System  
Developing a **next-generation intelligent document orchestration platform** designed for scalability, compliance, and automation. Key features:  
- **Data Layer**: **NeonDB** stores metadata, versioning, and access logs for every file.  
- **GCP Integration**: **Google Cloud Storage** handles file content, enabling high-volume, secure storage with redundancy.  
- **APIs & Backend**: Flask-powered APIs provide **upload, retrieval, permissions, and audit trails**.  
- **Frontend UI**: **Next.js + Tailwind** interface with **intelligent search, tagging, filtering, and document linking**.  
- **Automation Engine**: Automated **document classification, metadata extraction, and workflow triggers** (approvals, routing, archiving).  
- **Security & Compliance**: Role-based access, audit logs, and optional encryption-at-rest for regulated industries.  
- **AI Layer**: LLM-powered indexing and summarization allow users to query documents in natural language and generate auto-summaries.  

This project is designed as the backbone of an **enterprise-grade document ecosystem**, equally suited for **businesses, medical systems, and legal workflows**.

### 5️⃣ Neurological Patent & Development Platform  
Building a **multimodal AI system** for neurological diagnostics and research that integrates:  
- **Medical Imaging Integration**: MRI, CT, PET, and EEG/MEG scans ingested into AI pipelines for multimodal fusion.  
- **Neurological Database Connectors**: Integration with existing **neurology research databases** and patient EMR data.  
- **NeonDB + GCP Data Lake**: Structured storage of longitudinal patient records, genetic/lab data, and annotated imaging for AI training and inference.  
- **Flask/Next.js UI**: Secure dashboards for doctors, researchers, and patients to view progression, compare timelines, and export structured reports.  
- **Longitudinal Profile Builder**: Tracks disease progression (e.g., MS, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s) by fusing multimodal data into evolving **AI-generated patient profiles**.  
- **AI Orchestration Layer**: Uses GPT-based agents for **clinical note parsing, automated reporting, and treatment-plan suggestions**.  

The platform’s ultimate goal is to provide a **cloud-based neurodiagnostic ecosystem** — accessible to hospitals, physicians, and patients — that brings together **real-time medical scans, lab results, and clinical notes** into a single, intelligent interface to **improve accuracy, accelerate research, and support early detection**.
