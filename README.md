## 🚀 Current Missions

### 1️⃣ Modernizing AT&T's Voicemail Infrastructure  
Leading the migration and automation of a **90M-subscriber**, **6-region** Azure/Metaswitch voicemail system — transitioning from legacy Nokia hardware to a scalable, cloud-native platform.

### 2️⃣ Next-Gen E911 Emergency Platforms  
Designing and deploying **NENA-compliant**, AWS/Azure-based call-routing systems for **Intrado**, **Carbyne**, and **Motorola** to support AT&T's national ESINET PSAP transformation.

### 3️⃣ AI-Enhanced Medical Patent Application  
Prototyping a **Replit-based platform** that supports drafting, versioning, and workflow automation for provisional and utility medical patent applications — integrating **NeonDB**, **Flask**, and **Next.js** to accelerate innovation pipelines.

### 4️⃣ Business Development Database  
Building a **cloud-native CRM/lead intelligence system** in Replit that leverages **NeonDB** and **Flask APIs** for secure storage, paired with a **Next.js dashboard** to visualize and track community-scale business growth opportunities.

### 5️⃣ Intelligent Document Management System  
Developing a **document orchestration framework** in Replit that combines **NeonDB** with **Flask/Next.js services** to manage, search, and automate business and technical documentation — designed for scalability, auditability, and AI-driven insights.
